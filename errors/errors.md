# So I ran into a few errors on this assignment:

> **1.** Had an issue with plotting with Pandas.  Attached image PandasPlottingError.png shows the terminal error.  After investigating, the pandas  tools were stated under a different name, however that didn't work for me either.

> **2.** Had an issue with creating a DataFrame through Pandas as seen on PandasDataFrameError.png.  I could not find a fix to the problem online that worked.

> **3.** Had an error when running the f_test.  I tried to search around on stackoverflow for a fix, but there isn't a lot I could decipher from the terminal error.
> 
> **4.** Ran into problems with Matplotlib settings.  I followed the exact instructions on the website provided for the assignment, however I couldn't find anything useful.  
> 
> **5.** Seaborn charts were not popping out a visualization unline the other assignment.
